## This repository is no longer active, BUT you can still get access to the latest code
We will leave this repostiory in read-only because a lot of Dan's articles reference this repo, but you should be aware that we went through Roast and completely improved it from the ground up:

* We created a whole new design
* Everything is runnning on a Laravel API with a NuxtJS frontend
* We easily run a command and within 30 seconds we have our mobile app ready to be built in Android Studio and Xcode (from the same codebase)

You can learn about this in Dan's book:
